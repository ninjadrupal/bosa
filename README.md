# BOSA

Free Open-Source participatory democracy, citizen participation and open government for cities and organizations

This is the repository for the main application for BOSA, based on [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim).

It includes specificities for Belgian Federal Government, Regions and Citizen. 

## Prerequisites & dependencies

It is using the `decidim-antivirus` gem, which requires additional installations.

You need to have ClamAV installed on the target machine for the antivirus checks to actually work. With the default configuration, you will also need the ClamAV daemon installed in order to make the antivirus checks more efficient.

See:
* https://github.com/mainio/decidim-module-antivirus#prerequisites
* https://github.com/mainio/ratonvirus-clamby

for more info.

## Development setup

You will need to do some steps before having the app working properly once you've deployed it:

* make local copy for `.env` based on `.env.example`
* make db setup via `bin/rails db:setup`
* start server: `bin/rails s`

## Development setup via docker

### Structure

There are following files related to docker setup for this project:

* `Dockerfile` - image definition for web app

* `docker-compose.yml` - services definition

* `.ops/.gitconfig` - you can setup here your GITHUB_TOKEN to fetch private repos

* `.ops/Aptfile` - list of project related packages required during build process

### Build process

* make a proper `.env` to connect to specific service:
```
DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_HOST=postgres
DATABASE_PORT=5432
RUBY_VERSION=2.6.6
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/1
```
*  Make local copy for `.ops/.gitconfig` based on the `.ops/gitconfig.example`

* create image for the app: `docker-compose build rails`

* make setup for the db: `docker-compose run rails bin/rails db:setup`

### Utilities

* run the rails container: `docker-compose up rails`

* run the sidekiq container: `docker-compose up sidekiq`

* run the tests: `docker-compose run -e RAILS_ENV=test rails bin/rspec spec`

* open container: `docker-compose run rails /bin/bash`

## Production setup

* Open a Rails console in the server: `bundle exec rails console`
* Create a System Admin user:
```ruby
user = Decidim::System::Admin.new(email: <email>, password: <password>, password_confirmation: <password>)
user.save!
```
*. Visit `<your app url>/system` and login with your system admin credentials
*. Create a new organization. Check the locales you want to use for that organization, and select a default locale.
*. Set the correct default host for the organization, otherwise the app will not work properly. Note that you need to include any subdomain you might be using.
*. Fill the rest of the form and submit it.

### [optional] Create an admin user for a brand new organization
It is already done by decidim seeds for default organization,
but when you create a new organization there would be no admin users in it.

```
o = Decidim::Organization.find(_YOUR_ORG_ID_)
user = Decidim::User.new(email: "admin@belighted.com")
password = "decidim123456"
user.update!(
    name: "Admin",
    nickname: 'admin',
    password: password,
    password_confirmation: password,
    organization: o,
    confirmed_at: Time.current,
    locale: I18n.default_locale,
    admin: true,
    tos_agreement: true,
    personal_url: '',
    about: '',
    accepted_tos_version: o.tos_version,
    admin_terms_accepted_at: Time.current
)
user.confirm
```

You're good to go!

## Capistrano deployment

You can deploy app via capistrano utils. Currently we support following stages: `staging`.

We have included support for:

* puma management
* sidekiq management via systemd

Commands:

* `bundle exec cap -T` - list of available capistrano tasks
* `bundle exec cap staging deploy` - deploy app to staging
* `BRANCH=master bundle exec cap staging deploy` - deploy specific branch to staging(default: master)

### Notes about for first deployment

If you intend to seed the database in production, it won't run in the production environment. It relies on Decidim::Faker that is available only on
development.
The procedure will be:
* set the environment as development
* run `bundle exec rake db:setup`
* set the environment back to production

Create a systemd service at user level to control sidekiq
In `/home/[YOUR_USER]/.config/systemd/user`, create a file called for example `sidekiq.service`
Setup the service
Then:
* Enable the service `systemctl --user enable sidekiq.service`
* Reload the daemon `systemctl --user daemon-reload`

Now you are able to start the service with `systemctl --user start sidekiq.service`.
